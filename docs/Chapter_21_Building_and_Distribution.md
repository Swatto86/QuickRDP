# Chapter 21: Building and Distribution

## Introduction

You've built a fully functional Tauri application. Now it's time to package and distribute it to end users. This chapter covers everything you need to know about building production-ready installers, optimizing for release, managing versions, and distributing your application professionally.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:
- Configure release builds with optimizations
- Create professional Windows installers (MSI and NSIS)
- Understand code signing and its importance
- Implement version management strategies
- Prepare documentation and deployment checklists
- Distribute your application through various channels

---

## 21.1 Release Build Configuration

### Understanding Build Profiles

Rust uses build profiles to control compilation settings. The two main profiles are:
- **`dev`** - Fast compilation, larger binaries, includes debug symbols
- **`release`** - Slower compilation, optimized binaries, smaller size

### Cargo.toml Release Profile

QuickRDP uses an optimized release profile in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"       # Optimize for size
lto = true            # Enable Link Time Optimization
codegen-units = 1     # Reduce codegen units for better optimization
panic = "abort"       # Use abort for panics to reduce binary size
```

**Let's understand each option:**

#### 1. `opt-level = "z"`

Controls optimization level:
- `0` = No optimizations (fast compile)
- `1` = Basic optimizations
- `2` = Default release optimizations
- `3` = Aggressive optimizations for speed
- `s` = Optimize for size
- `z` = Optimize aggressively for size

**QuickRDP uses "z"** because:
- Smaller installer size (important for distribution)
- Faster download times for users
- Minimal performance difference for GUI applications
- Modern CPUs handle optimized code efficiently

#### 2. `lto = true`

Link Time Optimization (LTO) analyzes the entire program during linking:
- Removes unused code across crate boundaries
- Inlines functions more aggressively
- Significantly reduces binary size
- Increases compile time (but only for release builds)

**Trade-off:**
```
Without LTO: QuickRDP.exe = ~4.5 MB, Build time = 2 minutes
With LTO:    QuickRDP.exe = ~3.2 MB, Build time = 5 minutes
```

For production releases, the smaller size is worth the extra build time.

#### 3. `codegen-units = 1`

Controls parallel code generation:
- Higher values = faster compilation (default is 16)
- Lower values = better optimization
- `1` = all code compiled together, maximum optimization

**Why use 1?**
- Allows LLVM to see the entire codebase at once
- Enables better optimization decisions
- Reduces binary size by ~5-10%
- Only affects release builds (dev still uses 256 for speed)

#### 4. `panic = "abort"`

Controls panic behavior:
- `"unwind"` (default) = Cleans up stack, larger binary
- `"abort"` = Terminates immediately, smaller binary

**For desktop applications:**
- Panics should be rare (most errors use `Result<T, E>`)
- Users benefit more from smaller downloads
- Crash reports still work with abort

**Note:** If you're building a library that others will use, keep `"unwind"` as it allows calling code to catch panics.

### Frontend Build Optimization

The TypeScript/Vite build is configured in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

**What happens during `npm run build`:**

1. **`tsc`** - TypeScript compiler checks types
   - Catches type errors before build
   - Doesn't generate JS (Vite handles that)
   - Ensures type safety

2. **`vite build`** - Bundles and optimizes frontend
   - Minifies JavaScript
   - Optimizes CSS with PostCSS
   - Tree-shakes unused code
   - Generates source maps (optional)
   - Outputs to `dist/` folder

### Tauri Build Configuration

The `tauri.conf.json` controls how Tauri builds your app:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "beforeDevCommand": "npm run dev",
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:1420",
    "beforeBuildCommand": "npm run build",
    "frontendDist": "../dist"
  }
}
```

**Build process:**
1. Tauri runs `npm run build` (frontend)
2. Frontend outputs to `dist/`
3. Tauri embeds `dist/` into the Rust binary
4. Compiles Rust with release profile
5. Creates installers in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

---

## 21.2 Building Your Application

### Method 1: Command Line

The simplest way to build:

```powershell
npm run tauri build
```

**What this does:**
1. Runs TypeScript compilation
2. Builds frontend with Vite
3. Compiles Rust in release mode
4. Creates all configured installers

**Output location:**
```
src-tauri/target/release/
  ├── bundle/
  │   ├── msi/         # Windows Installer
  │   └── nsis/        # NSIS Installer
  └── QuickRDP.exe     # Standalone executable
```

### Method 2: QuickRDP's Build Script

QuickRDP includes `build.bat` for easier building:

```batch
@echo off
REM Build script for QuickRDP Tauri application

echo Setting up Visual Studio Build Tools environment...
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -arch=x64 -host_arch=x64

if errorlevel 1 (
    echo ERROR: Failed to set up Visual Studio Build Tools environment
    echo Please ensure Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools is installed.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

echo.
echo Building QuickRDP...
echo.

npm run tauri build

if errorlevel 1 (
    echo.
    echo ERROR: Build failed!
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

echo.
echo Build completed successfully!
echo Output files are in: src-tauri\target\release\bundle\
pause
```

**Why this script?**
- Ensures Visual Studio Build Tools are loaded
- Provides clear error messages
- Shows output location
- Pauses on completion so you can see results

**To use:**
```powershell
.\build.bat
```

### Build Times

Typical build times for QuickRDP on a modern machine:

| Component | First Build | Incremental Build |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Frontend  | 10-15 sec   | 5-10 sec          |
| Rust (dev)| 2-3 min     | 30-60 sec         |
| Rust (release) | 5-8 min | 3-5 min          |
| **Total** | **6-10 min** | **4-6 min**      |

**Tips for faster builds:**
- Use `--target` to build only one installer type
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use `cargo clean` if builds become slow
- Ensure antivirus excludes `target/` directory

---

## 21.3 Understanding Bundle Formats

Tauri can generate multiple installer formats. Let's examine what QuickRDP creates.

### Bundle Configuration

In `tauri.conf.json`:

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "active": true,
    "targets": "all",
    "publisher": "Swatto",
    "copyright": "Copyright © 2025 Swatto. All rights reserved.",
    "category": "Utility",
    "shortDescription": "Fast RDP connection manager for system administrators",
    "longDescription": "QuickRDP is a fast and efficient RDP connection manager...",
    "icon": [
      "icons/32x32.png",
      "icons/128x128.png",
      "icons/128x128@2x.png",
      "icons/icon.icns",
      "icons/icon.ico"
    ],
    "windows": {
      "wix": {
        "language": "en-US"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### MSI Installer (WiX)

## 21.4 Application Icons

Icons are crucial for professional appearance. Tauri requires multiple formats and sizes.

### Required Icon Files

```
src-tauri/icons/
  ├── 32x32.png           # Windows taskbar
  ├── 128x128.png         # Windows Start menu
  ├── 128x128@2x.png      # High DPI displays
  ├── icon.ico            # Windows executable icon
  ├── icon.icns           # macOS (if cross-platform)
  └── android/            # Mobile (if needed)
```

### Creating Icons

**Option 1: Tauri Icon Generator**

Tauri provides a built-in icon generator:

```powershell
npm run tauri icon path/to/source-icon.png
```

**Requirements:**
- Source image must be at least 1024x1024 PNG
- Square aspect ratio
- Transparent background (optional)
- High quality (will be downscaled)

**What it generates:**
- All required sizes for all platforms
- Optimized for each platform
- Placed in `src-tauri/icons/`

**Example workflow:**
```powershell
# 1. Create a high-res icon (1024x1024)
# Use tool like Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma

# 2. Generate all sizes
npm run tauri icon app-icon-1024.png

# 3. Verify outputs
ls src-tauri/icons/
```

**Option 2: Manual Creation**

If you need precise control:

1. **Create ICO file** (Windows)
   - Use tool like IcoFX or GIMP
   - Include multiple resolutions: 16, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256
   - Save as `icon.ico`

2. **Create PNG files**
   - Export at exact sizes: 32x32, 128x128, 256x256
   - Use high-quality PNG with transparency
   - Optimize with tools like TinyPNG

### Icon Design Best Practices

**1. Scalability**
- Icons will be shown at many sizes (16px to 256px)
- Test at small sizes (32x32) to ensure readability
- Avoid fine details that disappear when scaled down

**2. Contrast**
- Works well on light and dark backgrounds
- Consider adding a subtle outline or shadow
- Test on Windows light/dark themes

**3. Simplicity**
- Simple shapes scale better than complex ones
- Limit color palette (3-5 colors)
- Avoid text (won't be readable at small sizes)

**4. Platform Guidelines**
- Windows: Flat, colorful, simple
- macOS: Rounded, gradient, 3D
- Linux: Varies by desktop environment

**QuickRDP Icon Strategy:**
- Simple computer/RDP symbol
- Blue color scheme (professional, trustworthy)
- Works at all sizes
- Recognizable in taskbar

---

## 21.5 Code Signing (Windows)

Code signing proves your application comes from you and hasn't been tampered with.

### Why Code Sign?

**Without signing:**
- Windows SmartScreen warnings
- "Unknown publisher" dialogs
- Users hesitant to install
- Looks unprofessional

**With signing:**
- Shows your company/name
- "Verified publisher" badge
- Builds user trust
- Required for some distribution channels

### Obtaining a Certificate

**Option 1: Commercial Certificate Authority**

Popular providers:
- DigiCert
- GlobalSign
- Sectigo (formerly Comodo)

**Cost:** $100-$400/year

**Process:**
1. Purchase certificate
2. Verify your identity (business verification)
3. Receive certificate file (`.pfx` or `.p12`)
4. Install on signing machine

**Option 2: Self-Signed Certificate (Testing Only)**

For internal testing, create a self-signed cert:

```powershell
# Create self-signed certificate (PowerShell as Admin)
New-SelfSignedCertificate `
    -Subject "CN=YourCompany, O=YourCompany Inc., C=US" `
    -Type CodeSigning `
    -KeyUsage DigitalSignature `
    -FriendlyName "YourApp Code Signing" `
    -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My `
    -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(2)

# Export to PFX
$cert = Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\CurrentUser\My -CodeSigningCert | Select-Object -First 1
$pwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "YourPassword" -Force -AsPlainText
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath "signing-cert.pfx" -Password $pwd
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Self-signed certificates still trigger SmartScreen warnings. They're only useful for:
- Internal company distribution
- Testing the signing process
- Development builds

### Configuring Tauri for Code Signing

**Method 1: Environment Variables**

Set before building:

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY = "path/to/certificate.pfx"
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD = "your-cert-password"

# Then build
npm run tauri build
```

**Method 2: tauri.conf.json**

Add to configuration:

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "windows": {
      "certificateThumbprint": "YOUR_CERT_THUMBPRINT",
      "digestAlgorithm": "sha256",
      "timestampUrl": "http://timestamp.digicert.com"
    }
  }
}
```

**Finding your certificate thumbprint:**

```powershell
# List all code signing certificates
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\CurrentUser\My -CodeSigningCert

# Shows thumbprint, subject, expiration
```

**Timestamp URL:**
- Ensures signature remains valid after cert expires
- Required for long-term validity
- Use CA's timestamp server

Popular timestamp servers:
- DigiCert: `http://timestamp.digicert.com`
- GlobalSign: `http://timestamp.globalsign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll`
- Sectigo: `http://timestamp.sectigo.com`

### Signing Process

**Automatic signing (Tauri):**

When configured, Tauri automatically signs:
1. Main executable (`QuickRDP.exe`)
2. Installer files (`.msi`, `.exe`)
3. Any bundled DLLs

**Manual signing (if needed):**

```powershell
# Using signtool (included with Windows SDK)
signtool sign /f "certificate.pfx" /p "password" /fd sha256 /tr "http://timestamp.digicert.com" /td sha256 QuickRDP.exe
```

### Verifying Signatures

**Method 1: Windows Properties**

Right-click `.exe` → Properties → Digital Signatures tab

Should show:
- Your name/company
- Certificate issuer
- Timestamp
- "This digital signature is OK"

**Method 2: signtool**

```powershell
signtool verify /pa QuickRDP.exe
```

**Method 3: PowerShell**

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature QuickRDP.exe
```

### Best Practices

**1. Protect Your Certificate**
- Store `.pfx` securely (encrypted drive)
- Never commit to version control
- Use strong password
- Limit access to signing machine

**2. Automate Signing in CI/CD**
- Store certificate in secure secrets
- Sign as part of build pipeline
- Different cert for dev/prod

**3. Certificate Renewal**
- Monitor expiration dates
- Renew 1-2 months before expiry
- Update all build scripts

**4. Security**
- Use Hardware Security Module (HSM) for high-value certs
- Enable two-factor authentication on CA account
- Audit certificate usage

## 21.6 Version Management

Proper versioning is crucial for updates, bug tracking, and user communication.

### Semantic Versioning

Tauri uses **SemVer** (Semantic Versioning): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

```
1.2.3
│ │ │
│ │ └─ PATCH: Bug fixes, no new features
│ └─── MINOR: New features, backward compatible
└───── MAJOR: Breaking changes
```

**Examples:**
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`: Fixed a crash bug
- `1.0.1` → `1.1.0`: Added LDAP scanning feature
- `1.1.0` → `2.0.0`: Changed config file format (breaking change)

### Version Synchronization

**The version must match in three places:**

#### 1. Cargo.toml
```toml
[package]
name = "QuickRDP"
version = "1.1.0"
```

#### 2. tauri.conf.json
```json
{
  "productName": "QuickRDP",
  "version": "1.1.0"
}
```

#### 3. package.json
```json
{
  "name": "quickrdp",
  "version": "0.1.0"  // This can be different (internal)
}
```

**Note:** `package.json` version is less critical as it's for npm, not the final app.

### Updating Versions

**Manual approach:**
1. Edit `Cargo.toml`
2. Edit `tauri.conf.json`
3. Commit with message: `chore: bump version to 1.2.0`
4. Tag the commit: `git tag v1.2.0`

**Automated approach:**

Create a script `bump-version.ps1`:

```powershell
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$NewVersion
)

# Update Cargo.toml
$cargoToml = Get-Content "src-tauri/Cargo.toml"
$cargoToml = $cargoToml -replace 'version = "\d+\.\d+\.\d+"', "version = `"$NewVersion`""
$cargoToml | Set-Content "src-tauri/Cargo.toml"

# Update tauri.conf.json
$tauriConf = Get-Content "src-tauri/tauri.conf.json" | ConvertFrom-Json
$tauriConf.version = $NewVersion
$tauriConf | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Set-Content "src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"

# Git operations
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to $NewVersion"
git tag "v$NewVersion"

Write-Host "Version bumped to $NewVersion"
Write-Host "Don't forget to: git push && git push --tags"
```

**Usage:**
```powershell
.\bump-version.ps1 -NewVersion "1.2.0"
```

### Version Information in Code

**Display version in your app:**

```rust
// src/lib.rs

#[tauri::command]
fn get_app_version() -> String {
    env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").to_string()
}
```

```typescript
// src/about.ts

import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';

const version = await invoke<string>('get_app_version');
document.getElementById('version')!.textContent = `Version ${version}`;
```

**QuickRDP About Window:**
```html
<!-- about.html -->
<div class="text-center">
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">QuickRDP</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-600">Version <span id="version">1.1.0</span></p>
  <p class="mt-2">Fast RDP Connection Manager</p>
</div>
```

## 21.10 Auto-Update Implementation (Future Enhancement)

While not implemented in QuickRDP currently, auto-updates are a valuable feature.

### Tauri Updater Plugin

Tauri provides an updater plugin:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-updater = "2.0"
```

```json
// tauri.conf.json
{
  "plugins": {
    "updater": {
      "active": true,
      "endpoints": [
        "https://yourdomain.com/updates/{{target}}/{{current_version}}"
      ],
      "dialog": true,
      "pubkey": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

### Update Server

Host a JSON file with update info:

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "notes": "Bug fixes and improvements",
  "pub_date": "2025-02-01T12:00:00Z",
  "platforms": {
    "windows-x86_64": {
      "signature": "BASE64_SIGNATURE",
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/QuickRDP_1.2.0_x64-setup.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
import { check } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-updater';

async function checkForUpdates() {
  const update = await check();
  if (update?.available) {
    console.log(`Update to ${update.version} available`);
    await update.downloadAndInstall();
    // Restart app
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Seamless user experience
- Automatic security patches
- Reduced support burden
- Version adoption tracking

---

## 21.11 Security Considerations

### Pre-Release Security Audit

**1. Dependency Audit**
```powershell
# Check for known vulnerabilities
cargo audit
npm audit
```

**2. Code Review**
- Review all `unsafe` blocks
- Check for SQL injection (if using DB)
- Validate all user inputs
- Review file path handling

**3. Permissions Review**
- Minimize requested permissions
- Document why each permission is needed
- Consider user privacy

### Installer Security

**1. Download Security**
- Host on HTTPS only
- Provide SHA256 checksums
- Sign installers (code signing)

**2. Installation Process**
- Request minimal privileges
- Clear installation path
- No bundled adware/bloatware

**Example checksum file:**
```
# QuickRDP v1.1.0 Checksums (SHA256)

8A3F9E... QuickRDP_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe
7B2D1C... QuickRDP_1.1.0_x64_en-US.msi
9C4E8A... QuickRDP-portable.zip

# Verify with PowerShell:
# Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 filename
```

---

## 21.12 Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Example

Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20
    
    - name: Setup Rust
      uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
      with:
        toolchain: stable
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    
    - name: Build
      run: npm run tauri build
    
    - name: Create Release
      uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
      with:
        files: |
          src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/*.msi
          src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/*.exe
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**What this does:**
1. Triggers on git tag push
2. Sets up Node and Rust
3. Installs dependencies
4. Builds release
5. Creates GitHub Release
6. Uploads installers

**To use:**
```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push --tags
# GitHub Actions automatically builds and releases
```
